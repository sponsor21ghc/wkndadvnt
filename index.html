		 <img src="dosImageGI.gif" width="480" height="480" alt="Picture with a quote"><br><br>Another blossoming Saguaro, and an Ocotillo.<br>Saguaro blossoms more noticeable, if only slightly so.<br>Truly don't know when an Ocotillo blooms.

		 <br><br>This Photo depicts a Palo Verde Tree.<br>I believe the Palo Verde and the Mesquite are related.<br>Bark here much smoother than the Mesquite (But as before photo from too far away<br>Can't even tell the variability of the roughness).<br><br><br><br>
